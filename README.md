## Hello ðŸ‘‹

This is a simple weather app that will display the current city, temperature, and weather condition with icons bassed off the user's current geolocation.

This app integrates with three different APIs:
- [tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io) allows me to get current weather data, which I use to display the current temperature and weather condition
- [sunrise-sunset.org](https://sunrise-sunset.org) allows me to get sunset/sunrise times, which I use to display different icons reflecting time of day
- [geoapify.com](https://geoapify.com) allows me to get the current city name, which I think is important to display to the user

## Getting started ðŸ‘ˆ

1. Clone the weather.ui repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adamsmithdev/weather.ui.git
```

2. Create a `_serviceConfig.js` file by copying the template at `js/api/_serviceConfig.template.js`

3. Add your own api keys from the services mentioned above and open the `index.html`
